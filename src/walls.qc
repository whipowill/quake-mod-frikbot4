metlslime on making walls disappear:

"i finally got it to work, and here's how.

1) to enable being solid after turning inivisible and then visible again, i only ever set the model using setmodel once, and from then on alternate between setting modelindex to 0 or the actual index.

Since setmodel is never called, the entity stays linked into the world with the original physics bounds. self.solid can be changed without issue.

2) for entities that are set to START_OFF, there was still a problem where they'd never appear at all, and never become visible. My hack solution is to wait 1 second, then make them invisible/nonsolid in a special think function, rather than in the spawn function."

quake doesn't catch when a bmodel turns nonsolid while it is the groundentity for 
other entities, so those entities stay floating in the air if they're at rest or
the 'wrong' movetype. it does catch when an entity's groundentity is removed, but
since a toggleable wall would be gone once killtargeted and thus not able to be
toggled actually, it's time for 

A STUPID HACK:

spawn an invisible duplicate of the bmodel with a tiny bit of velocity to give 
everybody resting on it a wee nudge so they forget their old groundentity, then 
kill the duplicate. :(

the older, worse solution was to just nextent() through the entire level and check
whose bounds overlapped the wall's bounds, in a loop that was guaranteed to limit 
the size of the level to however many entities could be checked before tripping 
the runaway progs loop protection crash.

other things that didn't work, for future reference:
- spawn a teledeath-style trigger around the wall that ~s FL_ONGROUND in .touch:
	not everything touches triggers (namely dead monsters), even after
	a force_retouch 2
- maintain a linked list of entities that have ever touched the func_wall in its
	.touch so there's a much shorter list of things to have to check: if a backpack
	falls on the wall, gets put in the chain, and is then picked up, the rest of 
	the chain is orphaned
- do that but it's a doubly-linked list: now every entity that could possibly
	be removed for any reason (and thx to killtarget that's everything) has to 
	have extra code handle its own position in the list when it is removed on 
	behalf of func_walls
